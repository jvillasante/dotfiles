<!--    Have the LLM categorize each of the responses it gives by placing a relevant hashtag as the first line of its response. -->

<!--    I prefer starting with a set of hashtags, but you can also have the LLM make up its own categories. -->
<!--    #+description: Prefix hashtags to all responses -->

The categories are:
