# msmtp does not support OAuth, so instead you will have to use user/pass. If you don't have
# two factor auth enabled, enabling insecure apps to access your email should be sufficient and
# you can use your normal password, but if you do have it enabled you will need to generate an
# app password. See the comments in the offlineimap config for details.
# Once again I'm using `security` to pull the password from my macOS keychain.
